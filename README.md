Radiant Backend Archive View Extension
--------------------------------------

This extension is intended for use with Radiant version 1.0 or higher.
It was designed specifically for heavy content sites.
It will divide children of ArchivePages into subpages per year and month.
Also, months that would expand with many pages are truncated to show only a dozen. A "more pages" link appears with which you can get more pages.
